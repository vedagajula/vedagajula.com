            These applications have become the reason for today's youth to become addicted to these types of content which is making them more and more addicted and making their attention span shorter. This has been tested and 
            has been proven that these types of applications where people are able to consume contents that consists of jump cuts and rapid motion within a short span releases dopamine
            in their brains and causes a lot of stress release that usually is caused by smoking. Experts recommend a process called "Dopamine Detox" to get rid of these problems. These kinds of 
            content have been proven to decrease the attention span of many people thus hindering their studies to a great extent.

        <p>
            Applications like TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc. are mainly affecting teenagers of today. They are being addicted to these kind of applciations and spend hours of their time in watching videos that are of this format.
            This reduces their attention span, making them lose focus on studies and as a result, their grades are going down as well.

        <div align="center"><img src='https://rishavkumar.io/veda/assets/tiktok3.webp'></div><br><br>
        <p>
            Addiction to these kind of short-video format applications are <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/"> due to the dopamine release</a> that happens in our brain once we scroll through these videos. It has been found that, addiction to this kind of social media releases 
            the same amount of dopamine that would have been released if a person was smoking. This is something serious to consider and improve our lives from. It essentially means that it is no less an addiction than being addicted to smoking and that is something to be worried about and bring 
            about a change.

        <h2 class="title">TikTok's Algorithm & Wall Street Journal's Bot Experiment</h2>
        <div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfczi2cI6Cs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>
        <p>
            I'd like to present to you one of the most important videos that helped me drive this article for everyone. This is a YouTube video posted by Wall Street Journal, one of the top media agencies in the world. 
            Here, they show an experiment that is being performed on TikTok to know more about their algorithm which is heavily guarded by it's parent company, ByteDance. Although the company mentions that they do not collect 
            much data about all of the users, Wall Street Journal's programmed bots find something else which is really disturbing. <br><br>
            Looking into such content and research the provides insight into how the "rabbit-hole" of TikTok works is one of the biggest eye-openers that I wanted to include for today's youth to understand how it is ruining their life. 
            For such applications, the algorithms are the main part that influence the entirety of their revenue and user retention. Making these algorithms devise such evil capabilities to drag people into depression (as mentioned in Wall Street Journal's research video) 
            is one of the things I strongly stand against for.
